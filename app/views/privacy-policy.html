                <p>Orchid JSW, Inc. ("Orchid," "us," and "we") is committed to respecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding personal information we collect from users of our website located at Orchideats.com (the "Site"), the mobile marketplace platform (“Mobile App”) and the Services (as defined below). Orchid provides an online marketplace designed to connects users (each a "Guest")  looking for home-cooked meals in their neighborhood with cooks (each a "Chef") who wish to sell meals to Guests (the "Services"). The Mobile App and Site features upcoming available meals (each an "Event"), including information about the Chef and the meal, including pickup information and price.</p>

                <p> 1.              Types of Information We Collect. We collect your information as described below.</p>
                <p>(a)             Information You Provide to Us.</p>
                <p>  	We may collect personal information from you, such as your name, phone number, e-mail address, zip code and password when you create an account to log in to our network ("Account").
                    When you post content (text, images, photographs, messages, comments or any other kind of content that is not your e-mail address) on our Mobile App and Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored in our servers and other users of the Mobile App and Site will be able to see it, along with any other information that you choose to make public through your profile ("Profile"). The information that you provide in your Profile will be visible to others, including other users of the Mobile App and Site.
                    We retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you store using your Account.
                    We may collect personal information from you when you sign up for Orchid's SMS list or RSVP to an Event.
                    We may collect (through a third party payment processor) payment information, including your name, credit card information, and billing information, in order to make payments to the Chefs for Events you attend or charge you for Orchid's fees (as described in our Terms of Service located here: http://Orchideats.com/termofservice).
                    If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.
                    When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional personal information.

                    We also collect other types of personal information that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services.
                    If you participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion, we will collect any data you provide in connection with that promotion.
                    We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Services.
                    We may also collect personal information at other points in our Mobile App and Site that state that personal information is being collected.
                </p>
                <p>(b)             Information Collected via Social Networking Sites. The Services may allow users to connect with various social networking sites (each an "SNS"). By connecting with an SNS, you are allowing the Services to access your information and you are agreeing to the SNS Terms of Use in your use of the Services. We may receive information from an SNS and that information may be imported to the Mobile App and Site (either as a part of your Profile or otherwise). Once you connect with an SNS, you may be able to post recent activity or content back to the SNS. Any information that we collect from an SNS may depend on your SNS privacy settings, so please consult the SNS' privacy and data practices. Further, you can edit privacy settings via the SNS, or disable the connection with the SNS by visiting the applicable SNS.</p>
                <p>(c)             Information Collected via Technology.</p>

                <p> (c)             Public Profile. Certain portions of the information you provide to us may also be
                    displayed in your Profile. As an essential element of the Services, most of the personal information
                    you explicitly provide to us when you register or update your Profile is displayed on your Profile.
                    By default, certain aspects of your Profile are public. Content you post to the Mobile App and Site is also meant for public consumption. We may display this content on the Mobile App and Site, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, that information can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information that you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you do not put personal information in your posts. Once you have posted information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it on the Services, you will not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected, and stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines).</p>

We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every website you visit. The links to third party websites or locations are for your convenience and do not signify our endorsement of such third parties or their products, content, or websites.<

                    who are under the age of 13.

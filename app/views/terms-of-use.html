                <p>The Nuts and Bolts: How the Services Work<p>
                <p> Orchid is an online platform or marketplace that connects Guests with Chefs so that they can arrange
                    for the purchase of home cooked meals. Through the platform, Guests and Chefs book Events directly with
                    each other. Orchid does not create, provide, own or operate the Events or the private homes where Events take place. Unless expressly stated otherwise within these Terms of Service, Orchid's responsibilities are limited to: (i) making the Mobile App and Site and its Services available and (ii) serving as the limited payment collection agent of each Chef for the purpose of accepting payments from Guests on behalf of the Chef.</p>

                <p>  Chef Applications: </p>
                <p> Content. As a Chef, you determine the terms upon which your Event will be
                    provided. You will submit an application to us that contains: (i) content and images that provide
                    biographical information about you and a description of your meals and proposed Events, (ii) the price to be paid for the meals and (iii) all applicable policies, restrictions and contractual arrangements (e.g., cancellation policies and liability waivers required for all Guests) applicable to the Event and Guests (collectively, "Rules"). Submitting an application is in no way binding on Orchid, Orchid is not obligated to accept your application or any of its contents, nor is Orchid obligated to promote your Events.</p>
                <p>Acceptance of Application. If we accept your application, you authorize us to post information about your Event, including: (i) your name, images, and biographical information, (ii) a description of the Event and (iii) the price you have set, on the Services. We may also promote you and your Events using the content you have provided, using any method and medium that we deem appropriate, including through e-mail, mobile applications and any other distribution channel owned, affiliated, controlled or operated by Orchid. Orchid may promote your Event to Orchid customers and potential customers based on geographic or other geolocational data, but will determine the customers and potential customers to whom your Event is actually promoted and made available, if any, in its sole discretion. Chefs are solely responsible for the Event, all content they provide regarding Events and any and all interaction with Guests.
                    Guest Bookings. Orchid provides a platform through which Guests can elect to purchase meals from Chefs and participate in Events (“Bookings”). As a Guest, you understand that Orchid's only role is to facilitate communications between Chefs and Guests for the purpose of Bookings and it's not responsible for content provided to the Mobile App and Site by Chefs or any aspect of the Event itself.
                    Chef Commitments. By participating as a Chef, you represent and warrant: (i) that the information you submit to us or post on the Services regarding your meals and Event is true and accurate; (ii) that you will make the meals and Events available to Guests in accordance with the information you provide and at the times and locations specified; (iii) that you have obtained and will maintain all necessary certifications and licenses and that you comply with all legal requirements, including but not limited to all applicable laws and industry standards (including business licenses, applicable food handling requirements, fire codes, zoning requirements, any required health and safety inspections and, to the extent applicable, the collection and remittance of sales taxes); (iv) that you will provide the Event without imposing restrictions or policies not listed in the Rules; (v) that you will not accept any gratuity or require additional payments not listed on the Mobile App and Site and Services; and (vi) that you will not solicit users to participate in an Event off the platform or otherwise circumvent any fees that are paid or would be payable to Orchid. You further agree that unless you obtain the express written consent of any Guest, you will use any contact information that the Guest provides to you only to communicate with the Guest about your Event and for no other purpose.
                    Guest Commitments. By participating as a Guest, you represent and warrant: (i) that you will comply with the Rules; (ii) not solicit Chefs or other Guests for any commercial, religious or other reasons; (iii) arrive on time and at the stated location to purchase the meals and attend the Event and (iv) pay the agreed upon price for the meals. You, as a Guest, agree and acknowledge that, to the extent stated in the Rules, Chefs, in their sole discretion, reserve the right to refuse participation in an Event without refund, including to provide a meal, if you violate any of the Rules.
                    Relationship between Guests and Chefs. Guests understand that Chefs prepare and provide meals in their
                    private home kitchens and all Events are run out of private home kitchens. Orchid does not control the
                    quality, safety, or legality of Events,(including the meals, the ability of Chefs to provide meals, or the ability of Guests to pay for Events. If you are a Guest, you provide to each Chef the covenants provided to Orchid in Sections 1(e). If you are a Chef, you provide to each Guest the covenants provided to Orchid in Section 1(d). Guests and Chefs each acknowledge that the other is a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, but solely with respect to those provisions.</p>
                <p>Payment Processing: Payment processing services for chefs on www.orchideats.com are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to this agreement or continuing to operate as a chef on Orchid Eats, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Orchid Eats enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Orchid Eats accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Orchid Eats to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.</p>

                <p>ORCHID’S LEGAL DISCLAIMERS</p>
                <p>Compliance with Laws. As noted above, Chefs are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and local ordinances, including without limitation, obtaining necessary permits and/or licenses, including business licenses, alcohol licenses and any other applicable license, compliance with fire codes, zoning ordinances and any required or applicable health and safety rules, regulations or inspections (collectively, “Regulations”), collection and payment of any applicable taxes or other payments that may be applicable to Events. Orchid makes no representation relating to and does not offer any opinion, recommendation, or advice regarding the legality of, tax implications and liabilities of, or any licenses, permits or other consents that may be necessary to provide any Event. Should you have any questions regarding laws or regulations applicable to providing meals or Events or regarding consents/applications/licenses necessary to provide any meal or Event, you should consult your own legal counsel. You further agree that you, as a Chef, are solely responsible for your Events and agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Orchid, its Parents, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, Officers, Employees, Agents, Partners, and Licensors, from any claims, suits, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) relating to or arising from your Events, including any violation of any Regulations, or other taxes and payments which may be applicable to your Event.

You agree to exercise caution and good judgment in all interactions with other users. Orchid encourages you to communicate directly with others through the tools available on the Mobile App and Site and to review your Chef’s profile pages for feedback from other users. You may also wish to consider using a third-party service that provides additional user verification.
                    Release of Liability and Hold Harmless. To the extent permitted under applicable laws, you hereby release Orchid from any liability related to: (i) any incorrect or inaccurate Content posted on the Services, whether caused by us or any user of the Services, or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Services; (ii) the conduct, whether online or offline, of any Chef or Guest; (iii) any injury, loss or damage caused by another user, an Event, any meal, or Content posted on the Services, whether online or offline; and (iv) any error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, communications line failure, theft or destruction or unauthorized access to, or alteration of, the Services' users' communications. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
                    YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE MOBILE APP AND SITE AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE MOBILE APP AND SITE AND SERVICES AND ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE MOBILE APP AND SITE OR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND ORCHID HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE MOBILE APP AND SITE AND SERVICES AND ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE MOBILE APP AND SITE OR SERVICES EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ORCHID DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE MOBILE APP AND SITE OR SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT PROVIDED BY THE MOBILE APP AND SITE OR SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY USER CONTENT, WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE MOBILE APP AND SITE OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE MOBILE APP AND SITE OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY TYP OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES WILL CREATE A WARRANTY.
                    Limitation on Liability. NEITHER ORCHID, ITS AFFILIATES, NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
                    AGENTS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
                    CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF USE, DATA, INCOME, PROFIT OR GOODWILL, LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AND CLAIMS OF THIRD PARTIES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE MOBILE APP AND SITE OR SERVICES OR ARISING OUT OF ANY ACTION TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO OR AS A RESULT OF ANY CONTENT OR OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE MOBILE APP AND SITE OR SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PROPRIETARY RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT, PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE.

                    Community Interactions. The Mobile App and Site may include various areas that enable you to post information, provide feedback, recommendations, reviews, and comments, and otherwise interact with other users, either through postings or by interacting in real-time (the “Community Forums”). In connection with such Community Forums, you agree to abide by any rules that Orchid publishes in connection therewith, including but not limited to, the prohibition on use of the Mobile App and Site for any unlawful purpose. Although Orchid may from time to time review the Community Forums, you acknowledge and agree that Orchid is under no obligation to monitor or control, and will have no liability for, any information available via the Community Forums.

                <p>FEES</p>
                <p> Chef Compensation. The Mobile App and Site enables Chefs to connect with and provide food to Guests. Since each Chef is solely responsible for all out-of-pocket costs involved with each Event, the Mobile App and Site enables Chefs to set a per-portion price for their Event (a “Contribution”). Each Guest will pay the Contribution for such Event upon pickup. By reserving a serving in connection with an Event, you agree that your payment card or other payment means may be charged for the full amount of the Contribution upon pickup at the Event. A portion of your Contribution may be remitted to cover any Orchid fees, with the remainder to the Event Chef. Contributions are non-refundable.
                    Orchid Fees. Joining the Mobile App and Site, creating an Account and creating and searching for Events are free. Orchid does, however, charge a fee to Chefs for using the Services. The fees Orchid charges Chefs are currently 10% of all sales revenue, which we may change from time to time. Changes to that schedules are effective after we provide you with at least thirty (30) days' notice by posting the changes on the Mobile App and Site. Orchid may choose to temporarily change the fees, waive the fees or offer discounts for the Services, promotional events or new services (“Discounts”), which may be subject to additional terms and conditions.
                    Payment Information. All payment information that you provide in connection with the Services must be accurate, current and complete. By attending any Event, you authorize your payment card to be charged in accordance with this Section. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY PAYMENT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT MEANS USED TO PAY ANY CONTRIBUTION. You will be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to your payments and will indemnify and hold harmless Orchid from any and all taxes, including sales tax, based on any payments made by you in connection with the Services.
                    Mobile Text Message Terms. The following terms apply to everyone who signs up to receive one or more SMS or MMS message and/or messages from Orchid or sends us messages via SMS or MMS.
                    When you sign up for Orchid's SMS list or RSVP to an Event, you are expressly consenting to receive text messages or emails on behalf of Orchid, containing information about upcoming Events or Events that you have RSVPs to attend, in the following manner (the “Text Services”):
                    If you are a Chef you will receive a text message or email notifying you each time a potential Guest RSVPs to attend one of your Events, including Guest details such as the number of servings requested.
                    If you are a Guest or potential Guest, you will receive a text message or email notifying you of information regarding any Event to which you have RSVP's such as pickup information.
                    If you signed up for our SMS list, you will receive text messages or emails a couple times per week notifying you of upcoming Events.
                    You may opt out of the Text Services at any time by texting the word STOP to [424-341-3849] or email param@orchideats.com from the enrolled mobile device. If you do that, you will receive one additional message confirming that you will no longer receive messages from Orchid regarding Events. If you need help with our Text Services, text the word HELP to [(424) 341-3849] or call [(424) 341-3849], or email param@orchideats.com
                    We do not charge a fee for the Text Services; however, depending on your messaging plan, your mobile carrier may charge you for each message we send you or that you send us. It is your responsibility to know whether your carrier will charge you per-message costs (for instance, if you do not have an unlimited texting plan, or have exceeded your monthly quota of free messages). We assume no responsibility for charges incurred by your using the Text Services.
                    The Text Services may not be available in all areas at all times. This means we may not be able to successfully transmit SMS/MMS messages to you, and we have no liability for any such transmission delay or message failure. The Text Services may not work in the event of product, software, coverage, or other changes made by your wireless carrier or changes you make to your mobile device. You must provide your own wireless device, subscribe to a wireless service on a participating mobile carrier, and be able to receive text messages using that wireless device and your carrier's service.
                    Events. By cooking or attending any Event, you agree to, and at all times during the Event will, comply with the Orchid's community guidelines (the “Code of Conduct”) available here and below. In the event you bring any companions with you to any Event (“Your Companions”), you agree that you will notify, and make Your Companions aware of the Code of Conduct and the Rules. You acknowledge and agree that you will be responsible for and will ensure that Your Companions, at all times during any Event, comply with the Code of Conduct and the Rules. You further acknowledge and agree that you, not Orchid, will be fully responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of Your Companions during any Event. As such you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Orchid, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners and licensors (“Released Parties”) harmless from any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) (“Claims”) relating to or arising out of your and/or Your Guests' alleged (i) breach or violation of any covenant, obligation or terms and conditions in these Terms or the Code of Conduct, (ii) negligence of misconduct, and/or (iii) violation of any applicable law during any Event. You further agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Released Parties from and against any Claim made by Your Guest(s) arising out of or in connection with any Event, including any losses, personal injuries, death, or any other occurrence or event whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will have no indemnification obligation under this Section with respect to any Claims based upon or arising in whole or in part from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Orchid.
                    Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold the Released Parties harmless from any Claims relating to or arising out of: (a) your User Content; (b) your use of, or inability to use, the Mobile App and Site or Services; (c) your violation of the Terms; (d) your violation of any rights of another party, including any users; (e) your interaction with any other user; or (f) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. Orchid reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Orchid in asserting any available defenses. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Orchid. Orchid will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it. You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of your Account, the Terms, or your access to the Mobile App and Site or Services.</p>

                <p>DISPUTE RESOLUTION: ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURISDICTION.</p>

                <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS</p>
                <p>Except for a claim by Orchid of infringement or misappropriation of Orchid's intellectual property rights, any and all disputes between you and the Company are subject to mandatory arbitration. We anticipate that most disputes between us can be resolved informally by following the informal dispute resolution process set forth below. In the event that we cannot informally resolve a dispute, then you and Orchid agree to be bound by the agreement to resolve disputes through the binding arbitration process described in this Section. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly. The Federal Arbitration Act governs this agreement to arbitrate and the arbitrator, and not any state or federal court, has exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising between us, including disputes regarding the scope, enforceability and/or applicability of this Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate governs all disputes between us that arise out of or relate to this agreement or the Services, regardless of whether they are based in contract, tort, statute or any other legal theory and expressly includes, but not limited to: (1) claims relating to advertising; (2) claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement; (3) claims that arise after the termination of this Agreement; and (4) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class (“Disputes”)</p>

                <p>The only Disputes that are not covered by this Section are: (1) small claims actions; (2) claims to enforce intellectual property rights; (3) claims arising out of or relating to unauthorized use of intellectual property, including but not limited to piracy or theft.</p>
                <p> Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: Before initiating arbitration, you and Orchid agree to first make a good faith and reasonable attempt to informally resolve any Dispute. You and Orchid agree that informal dispute resolution procedures will begin by one party notifying the other in writing of the nature of the dispute. The written notice of dispute shall contain all information reasonably necessary to engage in good faith negotiations. Consumers invoking this section agree to provide information sufficient to identify the Orchid account at issue as well as the meal and Chef at issue, if applicable. If Orchid invokes this procedure, then it agrees to provide contact information for Dispute Resolution as well as information sufficient to put the consumer on reasonable notice of the nature of the Dispute. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith for at least 30 days following the date of the written notice of dispute. If after that period, the Dispute is not resolved, either party may commence arbitration pursuant to the procedure set forth below. Notices of Dispute should be sent to Orchid Eats, 1908 West 20th St., Los Angeles, CA 90018
                    Procedure for Binding Arbitration. If the Dispute is not resolved upon expiration of the 30-day period set forth in paragraph 1, above, then either party may elect to commence binding arbitration. YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Orchid ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. Arbitration shall proceed as follows:
                    Administration. Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and governed by its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“Rules”) as modified by this section.
                    Payment of AAA Fees and Costs. AAA fees and costs. There are filing fees and other costs associated with AAA arbitration. Each party shall be responsible for his, her or its share of the AAA costs and fees as set forth in the AAA rules.
                    Hearing Procedure. The arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions unless the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 and the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
                    Location. If commenced by a Guest or a Chef, the arbitration will take place in the county in which you reside at the time the arbitration is filed. If commenced by Orchid, the arbitration shall take place in the county in which you reside unless the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000. In that case, you consent to have the arbitration in Los Angeles, California.
                    Class Action Waiver. YOU AND ORCHID AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. This waiver will apply regardless of the type of relief sought (monetary or injunctive) and any relief sought shall be applicable only to you in your individual capacity. No arbitration shall be joined with any other and no aggregate proof or other class action or representative procedure is allowed. Unless all parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Any injunctive relief awarded shall be limited to the extent necessary to resolve the individual Dispute. This arbitration agreement shall be null and void if this subdivision (e) is found to be unenforceable.
                    Choice of law. The interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and California substantive law. Any claim that arises out of or relates to the Services and that is subject to arbitration under this provision shall be governed exclusively by California law (including the law of the Ninth Circuit where applicable), without regard to a conflict of law analysis.
                    Attorneys' fees and costs. If you are the prevailing party in any arbitration, then Orchid will reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys' fees, if any, incurred in prosecuting or defending arbitration under this section. This subdivision (g) does not include any attorneys' fees incurred in any court proceeding that is related to or arises out of the Dispute, including but not limited to fees incurred as a result of a motion to compel arbitration or any post-arbitration challenge to either the arbitration award or the arbitrator's authority that is brought in a state or federal court.
                    The applicable AAA Rules shall govern any and all aspects of the arbitration that are not otherwise provided for herein.
                    Modifications to this Provision. Orchid may modify the provisions of this agreement to arbitrate at any time. However, (1) Orchid will provide written notice of modifications; (2) modifications will become effective 30 days after notice of them is provided; (3) Orchid will not enforce modifications to this agreement to arbitrate to arbitration proceedings pending at the time of the amendment unless all parties consent in writing to the amendment.</p>
